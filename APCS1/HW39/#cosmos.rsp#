I thought looking at the history of the Cosmos and human history through a cosmic calendar was very interesting. It gave me a new perspective on the history of the universe and how short and recent it is, compared to the history of the Cosmos. This episode also made me rethink what I consider the universe and the Cosmos. It left me asking questions like “What is the difference between the Universe and the Cosmos?” If you consider the Cosmos containing various multiverses, then does it make sense to consider the Cosmos synonymous with the Universe? The story of Giordano Bruno made me feel sad, as does most stories of scientists in the past who are well ahead of their time. It also made me reconsider scientists of today’s age, and how something we might think as totally crazy or insane, can actually turn out to be brilliant and amazing in the future.

To be honest, I did not enjoy watching this video. But there were some interesting parts. I really loved the baby metaphor in the beginning that symbolized ignorance and that humans had to figure everything out themselves. I also found the etimology of "disaster" really interesting since it comes from "bad star" and comets were thought of as bad luck. What I took away from this episode was that not every reoccurance or pattern really means something and that I would have to research it more or try to find out more about it. A question I had was, what does he mean by the discovery was a shut door and that there were no more questions? Don't all discoveries lead to even more questions since you have agreater understanding of things? I want to add that the music in the end was great.
